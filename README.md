### Hi there, I'm Agathe ðŸ‘‹

I am french, and I am a young Javascript developer.

After almost five years at **[CGI](https://www.cgi.com/france/fr-fr)** as functional consultant, UI designer, and HTML / CSS integrator, I decided to take the step and learn how to develop web app.  
I just finished a 6 months training with the wonderful school **[O'clock](https://oclock.io/)**, to learn **Javascript** (front/back), and I specialize myself on the back side of Javascript.

Now, I am getting ready to graduate and look for a new job!

Let's keep in touch ðŸ˜Š
